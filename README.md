# STATS-507
This Github Repo contains some of my coursework and projects completed for STATS 507: Data Analytics in Python. This course provides a comprehensive introduction to Python programming and its applications in data science, algorithms, and deep learning.

## Key Topics:
- Foundations of Python: Data types, control structures, functions, strings, iteration, lists, dictionaries, file handling, and object-oriented programming (OOP).
- Algorithmic Thinking: Introduction to Big-O notation and fundamental algorithmic principles.
- Numerical Computing and Data Visualization: Tools such as NumPy, SciPy, and Pandas for efficient computation. Leveraging visualization libraries like Matplotlib and Plotly.
- Data Analysis and SQL: Structured and unstructured data manipulation, database integration, and SQL.
- Machine Learning and Deep Learning: Scikit-learn and PyTorch, covering supervised learning, deep neural networks, loss functions, stochastic gradient descent, and sequential modeling (RNN, LSTM, Attention, CNN).
